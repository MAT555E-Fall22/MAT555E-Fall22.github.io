Sciences\nCourse Instructor: Gül İnan\nCourse Summary:\n\nMAT555E is a graduate level course which aims to provide an introduction to commonly used statistical methods for inference and prediction problems in data analysis. The course will harmonize statistical theory and data analysis through examples. This course is designed such that:\n\n\n\nThe methods covered will include supervised learning algorithms with a focus on regression and classification problems and unsupervised learning algorithms with a focus on clustering problems,\n\n\nExtensions of these methods to high-dimensional settings will also be discussed, and\n\n\nApplication of these methods to data analysis problems and their software implementation will be done via Python (v. 3.10.6).\n\n\nAt the end of the semester, the students are expected:\n\n\nTo be fluent in the fundamental principles behind several statistical methods,\n\n\nTo be able to apply statistical methods to real life problems and data sets, and\n\n\nBe prepared for more advanced coursework or scientific research in machine learning and related fields.\n\n\n\nCourse Prerequisites:\n\nSince the course also touches on the mathematical and statistical theory behind the methods and uses Python for implementation, this course requires the following background:\n\n\nKnowledge of linear algebra, probability, statistics, and optimization,\n\n\nFamiliarity with Python’s Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn libraries,\n\n\nFamiliarity with at least one computational document such as Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, Visual Studio Code, or RStudio Quarto, and\n\n\nFamiliarity with Git and GitHub commands.\n\n\n\nClass Schedule:\nCRN:14267: Tuesdays between 14:30-17:30 at ***."
