For online attendees, each week, before the classes, a Zoom meeting invitation will be sent you via your ITU email to join the class on Mondays or Thursdays. Lectures will be automatically recorded and you will have a chance re-watch the videos after the class on Ninova. Lecture materials (notes, assignments, grades etc) will be uploaded on Ninova.\n\n\n\n\nThis course aims to:\n\nTo provide the concepts of sampling and sampling distributions.\nTo provide the applications of point estimation, confidence interval and hypothesis testing .\nTo provide the applications of regression analysis and analysis of variance.\n\n\n\n\nWe will closely follow the weekly schedule given below. However, weekly class schedules are subject to change depending on the progress we make as a class.\nWeek 1. Sampling from Normal Distribution.\nWeek 2. Estimation: The likelihood function and maximum likelihood estimators.\nWeek 3. Properties of estimators: Mean-square-error, unbiasedness, consistency.\nWeek 4. Fisher information and efficient estimators.\nWeek 5. Asymptotic properties of maximum likelihood estimators.\nWeek 6. Confidence intervals: (1-\\(\\alpha\\)) confidence intervals and Pivotal quantities.\nWeek 7. Testing statistical hypothesis and test statistics.\nWeek 8. Optimal Tests: Randomized tests.\nWeek 9. Powerful tests: power function, Simple hypothesis, Neyman-Pearson Theorem.\nWeek 10. Likelihood Ratio tests. Sufficient Statistics.\nWeek 11. ITU Spring Break\nWeek 12. One-sample, Two-sample and paired tests.\nWeek 13. Regression and correlation.\nWeek 14. Regression analysis: Simple linear regression.\nWeek 15. One-way and two-way analysis of variance.\n\n\n\nA student who completed this course successfully is expected to:\n\nUse sampling distributions,\nEstimation and properties of estimators,\nEvaluate confidence interval, testing hypothesis,\nOptimal tests, powerful tests,\nCompute regression and correlations of data,\nUse variance analysis,\nGet familiar with Python SciPy and statsmodels libraries.\n\nimmediately following the course, and/or a few months after the course.\nTextbook: All lecture materials.\n\n\n\nStudents are encouraged to consult the following sources on their own:\n\nHogg, V.H. and Craig, A.T.
