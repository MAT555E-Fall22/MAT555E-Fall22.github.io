# Course Syllabus

## Course Description and Objectives

<p align="justify">

`MAT555E` is a graduate level course which aims to provide an introduction to commonly used statistical methods for inference and prediction problems in data analysis. The course will harmonize statistical theory and data analysis through examples. This course is designed such that:\

<ul>

<li>To provide the fundamental mathematical, statistical, and computational concepts behind supervised and unsupervised statistical learning methods and algorithms for inference and prediction.</li>

<li>To provide extensions of these methods to high-dimensional settings.</li>

<li>To provide the applications of these methods in real life data sets.</li>

<li>To provide the implementation of these methods in Python.</li>

</ul>

</p>

## Course Type

This is a graduate-level elective course open to all graduate students at ITU.

## Course Credits

3 local credits.

## Course Prerequisites

<p align="justify">

Since the course also touches on the mathematical and statistical theory behind the methods and uses Python for implementation, this course requires the following background:

<ul>

<li>Knowledge of linear algebra, probability, statistics, and optimization,</li>

<li>Familiarity with Python's [Numpy](https://numpy.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), and [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) libraries,</li>

<li>Familiarity with at least one computational document such as [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/), [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), or [RStudio Quarto](https://quarto.org/), and</li>

<li>Familiarity with [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/) commands.</li>

</ul>

# Course Policies

Please read the information below as a reference for how this class will be conducted.

## Grading Policy

| Assessment Method    | Contribution to Final Grade |
|:---------------------|:----------------------------|
| In-class performance | 10%                         |
| Midterm exam         | 30%                         |
| Paper presentation   | 30%                         |
| Final exam           | 30%                         |

## Midterm coverage and date

The midterm will be on `November 3rd, 2022 between 17:30-20:30`. The midterm topics will cover whatever we have covered up to that week. The main aim of the midterm is to assess whether you are able to frame a data analysis problem, implement it, and report the results. The midterm will be hands-on and open-book exam. For that reason, you have to bring your own portable computer to the exam place.

## Group-based paper presentation (with report submission) and date

The group-based paper presentations will be on `December 8th, 2022 between 17:30-20:30`. When the semester starts, I urge you to visit [Proceedings of Machine Learning Research](https://proceedings.mlr.press/) and pick a paper published within nearly past three years (2022, 2021, and 2020) at [AISTATS](https://aistats.org/), [ICML](https://icml.cc/), or [NeurIPS](https://nips.cc/). I can anticipate that the content of these papers may be very heavy compared to our class topics. However, the main aim of group-based paper presentation (along with a report submission) is to asses whether you are able to read and understand a research problem recently carried out. The group size can be at most 2 and the presentation duration is 30 minutes (25 min. talk + 5 min. Q.A.).

## Final exam coverage and date

The final exam date will be announced by ITU SIS later in December. The final exam topics will cover whatever we have covered throughout the semester with more advanced problems compared to midterm. The final exam will be hands-on and open-book exam. For that reason, you have to bring your own portable computer to the exam place.

## Final Exam Attendance Policy

There is no VF rule to attend or not to attend the final exam.

## Make-Up Exam Policy

<p align="justify">

The students who miss either midterm exam or final exam due to a health problem can take a make-up exam as long as they have a valid medical report taken on the exam day. The medical report should be handed in immediately (within two days of its expiration). There will be **NO** make-up for missed in-class activities.

<p>

## Class Attendance Policy

The students must attend at least 70% of classes and are deemed responsible to manage his/her absences.

## Participation Policy

<p align="justify">

The students are expected to ask and answer questions, participate in in-class activities, and show their interest and engagement in the class.

<p>

## E-mail Policy

Please:

-   Use a proper descriptive subject line (which may consist of the course number MAT555E followed by a short phrase summarizing the subject of your e-mail).
-   Start off your e-mail with a proper greeting, introduce yourself (give your name), then state your problem as short as possible.
-   Finally, use a proper closing and then finish your e-mail with your first name and so on.

Feel free to send me e-mails. But be sure you that give me enough time to get back to you.

::: callout-important
-   E-mail messages sent after business hours and at weekends will be responded at the closest business hour.
-   Lastly, e-mails asking for grade grubbing at the end of the semester are not welcomed.
