3 local credits.

## Course Prerequisites

MAT 221/E MIN DD.

## Course Description

<p align="justify">  This course is an introductory level statistics course on introducing following concepts: sampling from a normal distribution, maximum likelihood estimation, asymptotic properties of maximum likelihood estimators, confidence intervals and pivotal quantities, testing statistical hypothesis and test statistics, optimal tests, powerful tests: power function, Neyman-Pearson theorem, likelihood ratio tests, sufficient statistics, simple linear regression and correlation, analysis of variance. <p>

## Class Schedule

`Section I (CRN:24163):` Mondays between 08:30-11:30 at OBL3 and <br>

## Course Logistics

<p align="justify"> This is a hybrid course. For online attendees, each week, before the classes, a Zoom meeting invitation will be sent you via your ITU email to join the class on Mondays or Thursdays. Lectures will be automatically recorded and you will have a chance re-watch the videos after the class on 
<a href="https://ninova.itu.edu.tr/">Ninova</a>.  Lecture materials (notes, assignments, grades etc) will be uploaded on <a href="https://ninova.itu.edu.tr/">Ninova</a>. <p>


## Course Objectives:

This course aims to: 

1.	To provide the concepts of sampling and sampling distributions.
2.	To provide the applications of point estimation, confidence interval and hypothesis testing .
3.	To provide the applications of regression analysis and analysis of variance.

## Course Tentative Plan

We will closely follow the weekly schedule given below.
However, weekly class schedules are subject to change depending on the progress we make as a class.

Week 1. Sampling from Normal Distribution. 

Week 2. Estimation: The likelihood function and maximum likelihood estimators.

Week 3. Properties of estimators: Mean-square-error, unbiasedness, consistency. 

Week 4. Fisher information and efficient estimators.  

Week 5. Asymptotic properties of maximum likelihood estimators.

Week 6. Confidence intervals: (1-$\alpha$) confidence intervals and Pivotal quantities.

Week 7. Testing statistical hypothesis and test statistics.

Week 8. Optimal Tests: Randomized tests.

Week 9. Powerful tests: power function, Simple hypothesis, Neyman-Pearson Theorem.

Week 10. Likelihood Ratio tests. Sufficient Statistics.

Week 11. ITU Spring Break

Week 12. One-sample, Two-sample and paired tests.

Week 13. Regression and correlation.

Week 14. Regression analysis: Simple linear regression. 

Week 15. One-way and two-way analysis of variance.

::: callout-important
* `Student studies, namely, homework and exam papers which are not written well, do not follow a proper mathematical writing language, and are hard to review, will get "0" credit for that question.`
* `Please read the general advice given at:`
  <http://ma117.math.metu.edu.tr/course-info/general-advice/>.

## Late Submission Policy

<p align="justify"> Students are expected to do homework assignments by themselves. Homework assignments will not be accepted after deadline. There are NO make-ups for missed homework. The students who have Covid-19 medical report during the submission periods can ask for extension only.<p>

## Final Exam Attendance Policy

 `At least 30 points from in-semester studies` (e.g., (Midterm * 0.4 + Homework 1 * 0.1 + Homework 2 * 0.1) greater than or equal to 30).

## Make-Up Exam Policy

<p align="justify"> The students who miss either midterm exam or final exam due to a health problem
can take a make-up exam as long as they have a valid medical report taken on the exam day. The medical report should be handed in immediately (within two days of its expiration). <p>

## Class Attendance Policy
 
The students must attend at least 70% of classes and are deemed responsible to manage his/her absences.

2. Start off your e-mail with a proper greeting, introduce yourself (give your name), then state your problem as short as possible.
3. Finally, use a proper closing and then finish your e-mail with your first name and so on.

Feel free to send me e-mails. But be sure you that give me enough time to get back to you.
